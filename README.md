# Pruning-on-decision-tree
The dataset used here is the breast cancer dataset and decision tree is fitted over the dataset.
To avoid the overfitting cost complexity pruning is done on the decision tree. Pruning is done to decrease the complexity and to increase the performance of the model.\n
In cost complexity pruning a learning parameter (alpha) is used to weigh whether nodes can be removed based on the size of the sub-tree. This is also known as weakest link pruning.
